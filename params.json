Being dead since 2012.\r\n\r\n### Why make this\r\nWell, church needs a information system to make good use of big data of new friends. That's all.\r\n\r\n### Why dead\r\nThe architecture created by Martin Ku(@martin0258) is suck. We want church to have a great foundation to walk long and bring big success in the future. Thus Ian created a new project based on ASP.NET and replaced it at 2012.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis project was authored by Ecross Team.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving interest in building great information system for church?
