        <h3>What is it</h3>

<p>A XOOPS module designed to use in torch church (<a href="http://www.torchchurch.com">www.torchchurch.com</a>) for looking after new friends. Being dead since 2012.</p>

<h3>Why make this</h3>

<p>Well, church needs a information system to make good use of big data of new friends. That's all.</p>

<h3>Why dead</h3>

<p>The architecture created by Martin Ku(<a href="https://github.com/martin0258" class="user-mention">@martin0258</a>) is suck. We want church to have a great foundation to walk long and bring big success in the future. Thus Ian created a new project based on ASP.NET and replaced it at 2012.</p>
